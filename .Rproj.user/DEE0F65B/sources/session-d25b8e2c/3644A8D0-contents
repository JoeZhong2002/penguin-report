# Introduction

In this tutorial, you will refactor the code into separate scripts corresponding to each section. The dataset we will use comes from the `palmerpenguins` package, which contains measurements of penguins from three species.

## Load Libraries and Data

library(tidyverse)

data <- read_rds("data/clean_data.rds")

# Methods

In this section, we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and prepare the data for modeling.

summary_stats <- read_csv("results/summary_stats.csv")
summary_stats

#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("results/bill_length_plot.png")


# Prepare data for modeling
data <- data %>%
  select(species, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g) %>%
  mutate(species = as.factor(species))

# Model

We will fit a classification model using `tidymodels` to predict the species of a penguin based on its physical characteristics.

library(tidymodels)

conf_mat_res <- readRDS("results/confusion_matrix.rds")
conf_mat_res


# Results

We evaluate the performance of the model using the test dataset.

```{r}
# Predict on test data
predictions <- predict(penguin_fit, test_data, type = "class") %>%
  bind_cols(test_data)

# Confusion matrix
conf_mat <- conf_mat(predictions, truth = species, estimate = .pred_class)
conf_mat
```

# Conclusion

In this tutorial, we:

- Loaded and cleaned the `palmerpenguins` dataset.
- Performed exploratory data analysis.
- Built a k-Nearest Neighbors classification model using `tidymodels`.
- Evaluated the model's performance.

title: "Tutorial 6: Refactoring R Code"
format: html
---

# Introduction

In this tutorial, you will refactor the code into separate scripts corresponding to each section. The dataset we will use comes from the `palmerpenguins` package, which contains measurements of penguins from three species.

## Load Libraries and Data
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

data <- read_rds("data/clean_data.rds")

```

# Methods

In this section, we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and prepare the data for modeling.

```{r}
summary_stats <- read_csv("results/summary_stats.csv")
summary_stats

#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("results/bill_length_plot.png")
```
# Model

We will fit a classification model using `tidymodels` to predict the species of a penguin based on its physical characteristics.

```{r}
library(tidymodels)

conf_mat_res <- readRDS("results/confusion_matrix.rds")
conf_mat_res

```

# Conclusion

In this tutorial, we:

- Loaded and cleaned the `palmerpenguins` dataset.
- Performed exploratory data analysis.
- Built a k-Nearest Neighbors classification model using `tidymodels`.
- Evaluated the model's performance.
